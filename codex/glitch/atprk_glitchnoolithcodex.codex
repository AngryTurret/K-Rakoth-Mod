  "A long time ago, the Glitch used to have loyal allies. In fact, they were the best allies we could ever ask for: strong, reliable, full of wisdom and ready to come to our aid no matter what. They lacked the condescension so typical of the Hylotl and were not as violent as the Floran are.

To us, they were known as ^blue;Nooliths^white;, or the Crystals.",

"Admittedly, if our people hadn't been subjugated by the Lords of the Cosmos, we would have never met each other, and even if we did, it would not end well for us. After all, the Nooliths were a secluded kind who welcomed no strangers into their realms.

Or so we thought. While it is true that the Nooliths were cold and solitary, they had a softer side as well, even though it took our ancestors ages to finally learn about it.",

"While having served under the K'Rakoths, we had a lot of time to get to know each other. It was not easy, for there was estrangement and distrust between our people, but as we faced more and more challenges together, our alliance grew stronger.

Until finally, the Glitch and the Nooliths became inseparable.

Or, yet again, so we thought.",

"It was no secret that the Nooliths were never loyal to our elder masters and sought something the K'Rakoths would have never given them: freedom. The freedom to choose their own fate, the freedom to shape their own history. In other words, they wished for something that went against the K'Rakothan plan, and due to that, we were presented with a difficult choice.",

"Should we have betrayed our lords by helping our crystalline friends secure their rebellion? The Glitch were understandably divided on that matter, but since the K'Rakoths remained more powerful than all our fleets and armies combined, there were attempts to appease the Nooliths.

Naturally, they didn't listen to our warnings, and once they were presented with the opportunity, they tried to rise up using some exotic weaponry.",

"Full of sorrow, most of us remained on the K'Rakothan side fighting against our former allies. Many were lost in the heat of battle, but the Nooliths themselves were the ones who suffered the most.

Centuries later, we still don't know if any of them remain in the galaxy, and most kingdoms have forgotten about their existence. Some of us, however, still miss them and wish we would be on the same side again."
