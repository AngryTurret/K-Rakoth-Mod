  "Your majesty, I am glad to inform you that a derelict K'Rakothan spaceship has come into our possession.

We discovered it in the middle of the Verdant Crescent system, emerging from a luminous portal. Granted, it was tainted by the forces from beyond our reality but not severely. Our skillful tinkerers have found a way to put it back together, and now it is almost back to its former might.",

"Although only a fraction of the spaceship's arsenal could be safely restored, it still has enough to be a formidable opponent in combat. Its inhibitors can disrupt enemy teleporters, and its powerful cannons shred anything in its way.

There was also a shattered pod with K'Rakothan attires littering the floor. Sadly, we know nothing about the fate of their owner.",

"Regardless, I believe this spaceship shall become a fine addition to our fleet. With its capabilities, our enemies shall think twice before bothering us.

Sincerely,
Captain Flintheart."
