  "Sooner or later, we'll have to face the truth: the ^green;K'Rakoths^white; will never return. There is simply no need to maintain these towering temples any longer. We have been doing this for ages, and yet we haven't heard a single word from our former masters.

Perhaps they decided to abandon us. Maybe they simply forgot we exist. Either way, the point stands: they left us behind.",

"In fact, it is entirely possible that K'Rakothan civilization fell while our ancestors were defending our land. Our current zeal could be entirely pointless. Am I the only one here who thinks about it?

We must forget the past and move on. We have a kingdom to defend, and we shouldn't think of K'Rakoths as of our only hope to survive.",

"Whoever reads this note, it's up to you to decide whether you forget about our neglectful (or supposedly extinct) precursors or not.

I'm leaving. I refuse to protect this cursed tower any longer."
