    "^green;INTRODUCTION^white;

Are you intrigued by the Ancients and their unbelievable achievements? Or maybe you just wish to learn galactic history? Either way, you are not alone.

We are the Relic Seekers, a Novakid organization that aims to uncover all of the mysteries that shroud the full history of our galaxy at large. As the name suggests, our main activity is searching for relics that prove our theories.",

"While our organization is not big yet, our space trains regularly make stops in numerous systems, so you can contact us as soon as you see one.

^green;RELIC EXCHANGE PROGRAM^white;

In case you have found any valuable artifacts, we are always open for trade. Our Relic Exchange desks provide you with a list of relics we need at the moment and rewards we are ready to give for them. Available rewards may include rare artifacts we have already researched.",

"^green;RELIC RECONSTRUCTION^white;

Sometimes ancient artifacts cannot be recovered in one piece immediately, and recombining them may require special equipment. For this reason, we have a unique crafting station installed on each of our space trains - the Reconstruction Table.

With its help, you will be able to piece certain broken relics together. In case you want to obtain your own personal Reconstruction Table, feel free to discuss it at the Relic Exchange desk.",

"^green;THE ELDER RACES^white;

The previous inhabitants of the galaxy are one of our main research priorities, since their artifacts provide much valuable data. Currently, we collect information about these following races:

K'Rakoths - a species of aquatic molluscoids who built underwater cities on numerous ocean planets. Their technology level was incredibly high, and they had great influence on few races.",

"The Ancients - a race of extremely intelligent beings that seemed to protect smaller civilizations from outside threats. Most of the intact structures built by them appear to be parts of a galactic portal network, but certain cold planets feature city ruins as well.

Fenrons - a relatively primitive race that tried to build settlements in dense jungles. Various sources suggest that they interacted with K'Rakoths.",

"Nooliths - beings that can be described as sapient crystals. Not much is known about them other than the fact that they mostly settled on cold, tundra-like planets.

Annelisks - a race whose origin remains unknown, but it is certain that they attempted to build colonies on scorched planets.

Of course, there were many other elder races, and we keep our archives updated to include all of them.",

"^green;SEEKING THE ANSWERS^white;

Now that you know the essential information about the Relic Seekers, it is up to you to decide: will you help us find and preserve the knowledge of the elder races? The galaxy is vast and full of mysteries, and it is our duty to let everyone know about the beauty of the world we live in.

The Relic Seekers - trying to remember everything you may forget."
