    "Object: Prototype T-027.
Goal: Determine whether T-027 is capable of using organic matter in the terraforming process.
Input: Flesh samples extracted from Feral specimens.
Result: T-027 transformed one half of the testing chamber into dead biomass. The other half remained unaffected.

Conclusion: As expected, terraforming devices can transform matter into organic materials. Further testing recommended.",

"Object: Prototype T-027, rearranged.
Goal: Attempt to increase terraforming range of T-027 to convert more matter inside the testing chamber.
Input: Flesh samples extracted from Poptop specimens.
Result: The entire chamber was transformed into living biomass. It appeared to be conscious for 5 minutes, after which it expired.

Conclusion: Our previous theories are confirmed: transformed matter can also be animated. Further testing recommended.",

"Object: Prototype T-028.
Goal: Attempt to transform the testing chamber using samples from other creatures.
Input: Flesh samples extracted from Gestalt specimens.
Result: The entire facility, as well as the surrounding area (2.5 km), was transformed into living biomass. The incident caused severe casualties among personnel.

Conclusion: It is highly recommended to decrease terraforming range of T-028 for further testing.",

"Object: Prototype T-028, rearranged.
Goal: Determine whether T-028 is capable of creating autonomous living beings.
Input: Flesh samples extracted from Gestalt specimens.
Result: The entire chamber was transformed into biomass nearly identical to applied samples, with large organic growths on its surface. 2 days later, several creatures hatched from them and formed a small colony.

Conclusion: Further testing recommended.",

"Object: Prototype T-028.
Goal: Repeat the previous test to confirm its results.
Input: Flesh samples extracted from Gestalt specimens.
Result: None.

Notes: This test was sabotaged by radical members of a religious organization known as the Prophecy of Ri'shaan. The incident caused casualties among personnel and loss of Prototype T-028. Further testing suspended."
