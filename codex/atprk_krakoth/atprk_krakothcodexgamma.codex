  "Species 004: ^cyan;The Ancients^white;. 

A sapient species of unknown origin. We have never encountered a single Ancient specimen without some form of covering on nor any picture of their anatomy. Scan attempts prove to be ineffective due to some anomalous emissions. The only things certain about them is that they are humanoid and often have red eyes. Despite our best efforts, The Ancients refuse to elaborate on their exact nature.",

"The Ancients seem to be the oldest sapient creatures in the galaxy who preced even us K'Rakoths. Our observations show that they possess significant technological and cultural achievements with no equivalents found among the other known civilizations. They are currently building a network of arch-like structures across several systems. Their purpose is unknown.",

"Even though the Ancients were not the first civilization encountered by us, we have a long history of interaction. While we managed to acquire some of their technologies through trade, we failed to learn much about them due to their secluded and somewhat passive behavior. The Ancients show greater interest in developing civilizations rather than long-established ones.",

"Our citizens have varying opinions on the Ancients. On the one hand, many of us are fascinated by them and see them as the paragons of the galaxy. On the other hand, their ways are often enigmatic, if not suspicious. The fact that the Ancients don't engage in diplomacy as often as we do doesn't help the situation. Perhaps one day, we will learn their motives."
