    "^orange;Ri'shaan is one, and Ri'shaan is many, both at once.^white; While it may not be obvious to some of us, His loyal followers, He can create as many bodies as He desires, as well as control them all at the same time.

This is why Ri'shaan is all-seeing: He can send His newborn body to any planet of His choise and let it oversee everything that takes place around it.",

"We call those newborn bodies the Seeds of Ri'shaan. Once born, the Seeds stay inferior to His one true body for a while, and they need to grow big and strong enough to match it.

For them, the only way to do so is to consume the imperfect worlds they stay on. Through planet's imminent death, the Seed becomes mature and complete.

When the Seeds grow, Ri'shaan Himself grows as well.",

"Each Seed doesn't grow at once, however: it takes time for it to devour its planet whole, along with everything and everyone on its surface. And while Ri'shaan always knows what happens to His Seeds, they are still vulnerable to cosmic forces.

We, the Lords of the Cosmos, cannot protect them for Ri'shaan's good. Space is chaotic, and there are many powers greater than us. Do not lose your faith, though, for we have one elegant solution. We shall help the Seeds grow.",

"We shall locate each planet chosen by Ri'shaan, reach the deepest caves where the Seeds slumber and give them food. Not any food, but fuel to make each Seed grow stronger and smarter.

Our loyal servants shall become the fuel. With the Crystals' intelligence, the Ferals' strength, the Automata's resilience and the Worms' valor, the Seeds will get closer to Rishaan's perfection.",

"Our disbelieving brethren are not to be consumed by the Seeds of Ri'shaan yet, but those who try to sabotage our benevolence must be punished. We may cause pain to lower beings, but we do so for their own good. We do so for the better world.

Ri'shaan must grow, and so must His Seeds, for they are one."
