    "Dear followers of Ri'shaan, today we received good news: our disbelieving brethren attempted to raid one of the mysterious gates built by the Ancients.

While many of them have fallen at the hands of the enemy guardians, they have recovered many artifacts.

Among them is a wonderful machine that can transmute large areas of a planet into different biomes. For example, it can turn a lifeless field into blooming grasslands.",

"This machine works faster and better than anything built by our brethren, and with the right tools, it can be used many times.

If you wonder how it concerns any of us, I have an answer. Not only can we turn more land into perfect spots for our churches, but also spread the Seeds of Ri'shaan even further, as shocking as it sounds.",

"So far we know that the terraforming machine is able to transmute a great variety of materials into something else, including living matter. Rumors that one patch of land was turned into a horrible realm of flesh only proves it.

What I am trying to say is, as divine as the Growing One is, His body is still made of a tangible tentacle mass. Perhaps the terraforming machine can recognize His pieces and make more of them.",

"If my theory is correct, it will become a viable way to help Ri'shaan expand His rule, and His Seeds will be spread faster than ever. We must attempt to learn as much about the terraforming machine as we can and try to somehow make it work for Ri'shaan's good.

But first we must take it from the non-believers, whether by force or not."
