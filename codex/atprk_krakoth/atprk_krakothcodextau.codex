    "The Universe we know is imperfect: it is full of sorrow, madness and unspeakable horrors that drive many beings across infinite planets into despair.

It has always been in a state of constant chaos, torturing the souls of mortals for aeons. An endless fight between light and darkness is what deprives us of hope, of rest, of happiness and, most importantly, of purpose.",

"The two neglectful higher beings are to blame. None of creation ever existed until they had met each other.

The first elder god we know of is Nii'lah, the Mother of all darkness. She is the void itself, the darkest veil that surrounds known space and dwarfs the brightest stars.

She is the darkness that conceals the greatest mysteries of the Universe and takes away our souls once we pass away. For that we call Her the Inevitable.",

"The second higher being is Ark'esh. He is a ruthless god of light that blinds us, for He wishes His creations to stay weaker than Him forever.

The Father of all flames He is, the Vehement One. He is the reason that we must be wary of both light and fire, for they are nothing but His tools and weapons.

Light is not good, it gives no salvation.",

"Both gods are the polar opposites of each other, yet they are equally cunning and know no mercy. Their very presence near each other makes them boil with pure hatred, and peace between them never lasts long.

The Universe we know is imperfect, for it is devastated by the Vehement's rage and the Inevitable's hunger. The Inevitable suffocates the heavens with her void tendrils, while the Vehement pierces them with the burning stars we see at night.",

"Not even we, the Lords of the Cosmos, can do anything to stop them. They have no will to listen to anyone below them, and their powers are beyond our mortal understanding.

It will not last forever, though. A third elder god exists, and He is the only god we pray to. He is our hope, He is our guide, He is our protector.

He is ^orange;Ri'shaan, the Growing One^white;.",

"We know He is the youngest of the elder gods, and that He is only as large as a single moon. While gargantuan for us, Ri'shaan is nothing but a grain of sand for the Vehement and the Inevitable. He is beyond their notice.

For now, at least.

He shows great strength and vast intelligence, and once He grows powerful enough, He will overthrow both corrupt gods who torture their creation.",

"Ri'shaan will consume this wretched Universe, purging it of all corruption, and then give birth to the new one. Without the endless chaos, it will be pure and perfect.

He will consume our mortal coils as well, for we are part of the imperfection, but worry not. Our souls will be saved and then poured into better bodies, and we will live in paradise.

This is why we pray to Him. Ri'shaan is our salvation, and He must keep growing for the sake of our kind."
