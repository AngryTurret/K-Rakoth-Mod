  "Everything proceeds according to His vision. With our tireless devotion, He has managed to descend upon many worlds and envelop them in His divine love, cleansing them of impurities. No more will they suffer from damnation imposed by the tyrant gods.

Those of you who remain faithful to Ri'shaan against all temptation, remember: He is grateful. Soon your loyalty will be rewarded.",

"Until then, however, we must stay the course, for our divine mission is not over until the Universe accepts His embrace. Iconoclasts and heretics never rest.

Spoiled by false promises of safety, they willfully blind themselves to Ri'shaan's Truth. Their harmful teachings force people to depend on technology and trample on those less fortunate. This is why vigilance is a virtue. A true believer will not accept their attempts to prolong the Universe's suffering.",

"As always, our goal is to spread Ri'shaan's warm radiance by any means necessary. Many fail to understand His love for living beings, so it is our responsibility to guide them into His many open arms. We must believe in our ability to accomplish this, just like the Growing One Himself believes in our potential.

Ri'shaan must grow, and we will grow by His side. This is the only rightful path to take."
