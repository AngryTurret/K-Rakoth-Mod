  "Species 002: ^orange;The Gestalt^white;. 

Rather than a species of numerous independent individuals, the Gestalt may be characterized as a colossal superorganism, each part of which is coordinated by a single consciousness. The Gestalt is known to absorb both biomass and non-organic materials to sustain its growth. Each Gestalt patch has so far been recorded to grow large enough to count as a biome itself.",

"While this superorganism is not known to be capable of creating even the most primitive tools, its behavior consistently proves its sapience. It also appears to be in posession of psionic powers such as teleportation, limited mental influence and the ability to create portals at will. This allows it to adapt to any environment, as long as it has any biomass.",

"Our efforts at establishing communication with the Gestalt have proven to be mostly unsuccessful due to its hostile behavior. Nevertheless, several attempts at subjugating some of the Gestalt's drone organisms were made. The resulting specimens could be used for menial labor, but they were less efficient than other servant races and thinking machines. It has been confirmed that the Gestalt's will interferes with our commands.",

"Due to its seemingly supernatural powers and strength, the Gestalt was promptly revered by a large portion of our population. This resulted in founding of a religion around it - the Prophecy of Ri'shaan. The fact that the Gestalt was among the first alien lifeforms we discovered also contributed to it."
