    "^cyan;The Ancients^white;... Those arrogant, indifferent yet advanced beings. No matter how hard we try to improve our own technology, they are always one step ahead.

While we were trying to manipulate the higher dimensions, the Ancients already constructed entire pocket dimensions. We kept improving our FTL drives, all while they were able to teleport across the galaxy on a whim. Even their automated guardians are more sophisticated than our thinking machines.",

"This is humiliating. And they know it. They may look all polite and cordial, but it is nothing but a ruse to conceal the fact that they don't view us as equals.

For them, we are just another race of primitives to meddle with. They judge us and our ways the second we look away, they pity us. The reason they are so reluctant to engage in diplomacy more often? They think we have nothing to offer.",

"We must remind the Ancients that they are not the only intelligent beings in the galaxy, and that we, K'Rakoths, should never be underestimated. We must reject those false, self-proclaimed gods."
