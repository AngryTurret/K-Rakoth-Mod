    "The Mother of all darkness. The Inevitable. The Darkest Void. Nii'lah. She has a great multitude of names, yet everyone knows whom they belong to.

She is the hungering void that absorbs whole worlds. Most planets never leave Her womb once consumed, and no one knows what horrors they are exposed to. And those rare planets that manage to escape Her cold grasp turn into nothing but shadows of their former selves... And those shadows terrify us.",

"Their surface is darker than night, and the skies are forever coated in heavy clouds that hardly let any light reach the ground. One can explore those warped worlds, but one shall find nothing but deadly chill and desolation.

Planets like those are home to abominable creatures of pure darkness - the spawns of Nii'lah. Because they defy our understanding, under no circumstances must such beings be trusted.",

"We cannot stop new shadow planets from spawning, for Nii'lah is merciless, but we can still save them with our faith. We shall build Ri'shaan's Beacons across all dark realms to repel the Inevitable's corruption. Only Ri'shaan's radiance can cleanse it, and nothing else."
