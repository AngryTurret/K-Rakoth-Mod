  "This is it: the inmates are running the asylum. Whenever you go, you bump into those madmen foaming at the mouth about the Gestalt and its needs. Our former allies are strung along with this insanity and join the cult; those who refuse try to flee, becoming the next target for forceful assimilation.

And the government? Many prominent officials have ties to the Church of the Growing One, so of course one should not expect them to help.",

"No wonder the Ancients want us gone. As long as the Gestalt forces our people onto the path of conquest, they will see us as nothing but its extension, something they deem unsalvageable. If there was any hope to mend our relationship, it is now void.

The Tek'mellian Federation is on its last tentacles, and everything we've been striving for will crumble.",

"My only refuge in this grim reality is trusting the grand plan to work out. It's relieving to know people who are not out to get me, the ones who saw it all coming and prepared in advance.

Granted, rebuilding the civilization once we wake up in the future will be an arduous toil, but at this point I've got nothing to lose. If I have to wait out centuries to escape this nightmare, then so be it.",

"I also know that I'll not stay aimless in this new world far ahead (assuming there will be one left). After all, I haven't spent years tending to agricultural machinery for nothing, and people will always need to eat."
