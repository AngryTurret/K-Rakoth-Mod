## K'Rakoths, the Lords of the Cosmos

This mod adds dungeons, biomes and lore related to K'Rakoths, an old aquatic race that used to have advanced technology, expanded knowledge of the universe and several servant species. However, no matter what they did, they were always overshadowed by the Ancients and with each generation, they grew envious of them. In a desperate attempt to outclass the Ancients, K'Rakoths declared the arms race that somehow ended in their downfall. Whatever had happened to them, it's up to you to find out!

## Planets
- **Ashy** - relatively young planets known for moderate volcanic activity yet safe to traverse even when you don't have heat protection. Multiple Glitch fortresses can be found there.
- **Boiling** - high-tier planets once occupied by the K'Rakoths. Here you can find their ruins and large amounts of Chthonic Scraps you can smelt into alloys. Moreover, there are two unique mini-biomes: you may either run into a deadly minefield or discover a sponge-infested ocean floor.
- **Chthonian** - an uncommon type of moons found around fiery stars. While it offers more resources than regular moons, it also has more dangers such as increased gravity, hard rocks and more hostile erchius entities.

## Dungeons
- **Glitch Devout Tower**. A certain Glitch kingdom was among the four servant races uplifted by K'Rakoth people. To show their loyalty, Glitch built tall temples across their realms. Most of those temples were lost forever, but some of them are still intact and can be explored. Be wary, though: more often than not, the towers are protected by force fields that can be deactivated, but to do so, you must fight off the remaining Glitch servants.
- **Underwater Ruins**. A little that has left of K'Rakothan underwater cities. Many years ago, those cities were densely populated, and the local architecture looked nothing like anything built by the other races. As much as centuries of abandonment worn down most buildings, many K'Rakothan relics survived thanks to some unknown materials, and any brave soul can attempt to recover them if they are ready to face hostile underwater fauna and naval mines.
- **Area 48**. A top-secret military base where the Miniknog scientists research all sorts of technology recovered from ancient ruins. Some tech has already been reverse-engineered, while many other objects still puzzle the Apex and are kept in secure hangars, where no unauthorized personnel can see them. The area is protected by heavily armed guards, and the entrance is littered in land mines.
- **Church of Ri'shaan**. Ri'shaan is believed to be an elder deity some K'Rakoths used to worship. Naturally, they constructed spacious churches where they could pray to him undisturbed by non-believers. Each church goes deep underground, and no one is sure what lies on the bottom floor. While most of them are abandoned and infested by Batongs, they still tend to attract cultists of all sorts.
- **Terraforming Laboratory**. Once ago, K'Rakoths raided one of the Ancient Vaults and recovered some technologies, including terraformers. These technologies are still kept in vast underground complexes filled with water, security robots and all sorts of elder machinery. Keep in mind that they are also protected by force fields.
- **Submerged Citadel**. A massive fortified structure hidden below the waves of Boiling planets. Due to its great importance to the K'Rakoths, it is guarded by advanced security robots, and many of its passages are normally blocked off. You will need the Distortion Sphere tech to traverse it.

## Mini-Biomes
- **Radiotrophic**, an irradiated forest of short but durable trees. Spawns on Alien planets.
- **Hunger Grove**, an overgrown terrain infested by countless predatory plants. Spawns on Jungle planets.
- **Ancient Necropolis**, a remnant of once grand city built by the Ancients. Spawns on Midnight planets.
- **Glaciovolcanic**, an icy biome rich in ores and crystals. Spawns on Tundra planets.
- **Polluted**, a ruined settlement left behind by a forgotten race. Spawns on Scorched planets.
- **Ship Graveyard**, a barren wasteland littered with space debris. Spawns on Scorched planets.
- More cave variants, including the counterparts of the aforementioned mini-biomes.

## Other features
- K'Rakoth codex entries. Unlike the contemporary races, K'Rakoths used their own language. Before their entries can be read, you must translate them using a device that can be obtained from the Relic Seekers.
- Speaking of the Relic Seekers, they are a new friendly faction that will occassionally show up in space. They will give you different rewards if you bring them K'Rakothan relics, tech and other artifacts. They will also provide you with hints if you don't know where to search for the mod's content.
- Various traces of the three extinct races that served K'Rakoths: fossils, small ruins and other minor things. No, they will not be playable, that sort of ruins the whole premise of the mod.
- New food and catchable fish with corresponding collection entries.
- New furniture and tenants to make your colonies more diverse.
- Many new microdungeons for different biomes.
