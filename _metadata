  "description" : "[h1]K'Rakoths, Lords of the Cosmos[/h1]\n\nThis mod adds dungeons, biomes and lore related to [b]K'Rakoths[/b], an old aquatic race that used to have advanced technology, expanded knowledge of the universe and several servant species. However, no matter what they did, they were always overshadowed by the Ancients and with each generation, they grew envious of them. In a desperate attempt to outclass the Ancients, K'Rakoths declared the arms race that somehow ended in their downfall. Whatever had happened to them, it's up to you to find out!\n\n[h1]Planets[/h1]\n- [b]Ashy[/b] - relatively young planets known for moderate volcanic activity yet safe to traverse even without heat protection. Many Glitch structures can be found there, as well as two unique mini-biomes.\n- [b]Boiling[/b] - high-tier planets once occupied by the K'Rakoths. Here you can find their ruins and large amounts of Chthonic Scraps you can smelt into alloys. Moreover, there are two unique mini-biomes: you may either run into a deadly minefield or discover a sponge-infested ocean floor.\n- [b]Chthonian[/b] - an uncommon type of moon found around fiery stars. While it offers more resources than regular moons, it also has more dangers such as increased gravity, hard rocks and hostile entities.\n\n[h1]Dungeons[/h1]\n- [b]The Glitch Devout Tower[/b], a colossal monument constructed by a zealous Glitch kingdom to honor its ancient masters. Commonly found on Ashy planets, the tower should become your first insight into K'Rakothan history.\n- [b]The Underwater Ruins[/b], a quiet, dark remnant of an abandoned K'Rakoth city notable for its strange architecture and metallic appearance. While not as remarkable as other K'Rakothan monuments, it is easier to enter and reclaim. Remember to watch out for sea mines and hungry fish.\n- [b]Area 48[/b], a top-secret military base where the Miniknog scientists research all sorts of technology recovered from K'Rakothan ruins. Protected by tall concrete walls and armed security forces, it requires the Pulse Jump tech and decent equipment to breach its defenses.\n- [b]The Church of Ri'shaan[/b], a place of worship dedicated to an eldritch deity of unknown origin. While most of it sank below the ground due to centuries of neglect, it is far from safe: wild monsters have found a new home within its halls, and you are far from the only person who wants to explore it...\n- [b]The Terraforming Laboratory[/b], an isolated research complex where K'Rakoths once tried to uncover every secret behind the mysterious art of terraforming. Nobody knows if they ever succeeded, but you can find out once you manage to get in.\n- [b]The Sunken Citadel[/b], a massive fortified structure hidden deep below the waves of Boiling planets. Even if its builders are long gone, an army of security robots still protects it from intruders. You will need the Distortion Sphere tech to traverse its many rooms.\n- New space encounters such as friendly [b]Relic Seeker Ships[/b], hostile [b]Devout Ships[/b], and rarely seen [b]Dimensional Tunnels[/b]. Can you find them all?\n\n[h1]Mini-Biomes[/h1]\n- [b]Radiotrophic[/b], an irradiated forest of short but durable trees. Spawns on Alien planets.\n- [b]Hunger Grove[/b], an overgrown terrain infested by countless predatory plants. Spawns on Jungle planets.\n- [b]Ancient Necropolis[/b], a remnant of once grand city built by the Ancients. Spawns on Midnight planets.\n- [b]Glaciovolcanic[/b], an icy biome rich in ores and crystals. Spawns on Tundra planets.\n- [b]Polluted[/b], a ruined settlement left behind by a forgotten race. Spawns on Scorched planets.\n- [b]Ship Graveyard[/b], a barren wasteland littered with space debris. Spawns on Scorched planets.\n- And many more!\n\n[h1]Other features[/h1]\n- [b]K'Rakoth codex entries[/b]. Unlike the contemporary races, K'Rakoths used their own language. Before their codices can be read, you must translate them using a device that can be obtained from the Relic Seekers.\n- [b]The Relic Seekers[/b], a new friendly faction you may find aboard their own spaceships. Make sure to report your findings to them and complete their quests to learn more about the galaxy's past.\n- Various traces of the three extinct races who served the K'Rakoths: fossils, microdungeons and unique objects.\n- New food and catchable fish with corresponding collection entries.\n- New furniture sets and tenants to diversify your colonies.\n- Many new microdungeons for different biomes.\n\n[h1]Compatibility and Recommended Patches[/h1]\n- [b]Material IDs: 62100-62121.[/b] In the future updates, it will be expanded to 62100-62125.\n- [b]More Planet Info[/b] and [b]TrueSpace[/b]: Compatible.\n- [b]Enhanced Storage[/b]: Also compatible.\n- [b]Frackin' Universe[/b]: Generally compatible but it's highly recommendable to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2605267672]install this addon first[/url].\n- [b]Arcana[/b]: Compatible but there is [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2607069863]a patch[/url] to make new dungeons spawn on Arcana planets.\n- [b]Project Ancient Cosmos[/b]: Compatible.
